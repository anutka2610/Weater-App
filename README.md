# Weater-App
This aplicetion is a final project SheCodes Plus module at SheCode course. 
I made it from scratch. I used HTML page (Home page, About page, Contact page, Work page), CSS, made application responcive and SEO friendly. Also I learned how to use library to stile web-pages and created navbar.

## Feedback
I am in the process of learning to become IT development. So have a loock on it, maybe you have idea how to improve it. To do this you need make some steps:
1. Fork the Project
2. Create your branch where you will show me your view (git checkout -b feature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'explane what was done')
4. Push your changes and I can see them (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
